BotAgent can't load pure .Net assemblies, even if referenced in .csproj and code is normally compiled (thanks .Net Core)

When updating some assemblies pack them into nuget package:
 - TickTrader.Common
 - TickTrader.BusinessLogic
 - TickTrader.BusinessObjects

1. You will need to update package version in build.nupckg\rebuild.all.cmd.
Otherwise package will be loaded from cache on build machine which will result in no update in release version even if it works for you.
Local package source is configured for solution, but caching strategy should be considered. NuGet thinks that package is different if version is different, so it will not cache updated file.
If you mess up with versions you can clean cache from %userprofile%\.nuget\packages. But you can't do it on all buildmachines each time you update dependency.

2. Run build.nupckg\rebuild.all.cmd.

3. Update nuget dependency from NuGet Manager. If you don't see package check "local" package source.
